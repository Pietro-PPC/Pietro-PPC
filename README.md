### Hello, I am Pietro!

I'm currently in a research internship at McGill University, in Montreal, Canada.

Beyond my job, some of my main interests are:
- Computer graphics;
- Simulations;
- Competitive programming;
- Parallel computing with GPUs.

The language I most like to use in my personal projects is C++, but I also have projects in C and Python.
